# guest-loyalty-data-analysis
SQL + Python project for analyzing guest loyalty behavior and purchasing patterns.

## Technologies Used:
- Python 3.x
- SQLite (for data storage and management)
- Pandas (for data manipulation)
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for data visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook (for analysis and results)
## Overew
This project involves the analysis of guest loyalty data to uncover patterns in purchasing behavior, loyalty status, and trends over time. The goal is to provide insights into the most valueable guests, spending patterns based on loyalty tiers, and spending trends over time.

## Data
The data used for this analysis is structured into two main tables:
- 'guests': Information about each guest, including their loyalty status and other basic details.
- 'transactions': Guest transaction records, including the amount spent and transaction dates.

## Analysis
The analysis is done by using SQL queries to extract relevant insights, and Python is used for data manipulation and visualzation. The key analyses conducted are:

-**Spending by Loyalty Tier**: Analyzing which loyalty tier spends the most.
-**Average Spending by Guest**: Determining which guest has the highest average spending.
-**Trends Over Time**: Investigating spending patterns over time, including spikes in transactions on specific dates.

## Visualizations
Below are some key visualizations generated from the data:

1. **Loyalty Tier Spending**:
